Create a musicXML player that loads and renders musicXML and plays back the audio synced to the displayed sheet music.

All code should be complete with comment documentation, clean and fast loading on all devices (PC, iOS, Android etc)

Milestone 01 - Proof of Concept for Player


Create a player that allow the user to select a properly formatted MusicXML file then render that file as an SVG in the browser using only javascript.
The music display should be one line of music notation and one line of bass guitar tabs
Show a cursor that aligns with the music notes and the respective bass tab and plays through the music left to right, auto scrolling the music to the end.

Milestone 02 - Complete basic play functions


The player should be able to play/pause/stop
Play audio that is generated in the browser by playing a sound font file that will be provided.
Display a scroll bar at the bottom so the user can seek to any point, select and play from that point.
Have ability to switch between vertical 'page view' and horizontal 'scroll view'

Milestone 03 - Full player functions


Incorporate my design elements
Add looping function with click and drag to select regions
Add tempo change and transpose capabilities
Allow zoom of notation
Allow selection of tracks - Meaning I can select sound font sound or a pre-recorded m4a file for audio playback


Task:
1. Select point and play from that point
2. Design Update
3. Add looping function with click and drag to select regions
4. Allow selection of tracks - Meaning I can select sound font sound or a pre-recorded m4a file for audio playback
